# StigFlow

Welcome to StigFlow-alpha by the [Common Sense [makers]](https://www.csensemakers.com). StigFlow is an automation tool for collective sensemaking that helps communities leverage collective intelligence and overcome the siloed, noisy app problems of coordination. 

## TL;DR

StigFlow enables you to configure automation flows triggered by reactions in various apps. It bridges across apps, enables you to route messages to selected targets, and makes it easy to set up different reactions to mean different things.

For more information on StigFlow, please see this [link](https://commonsensemaking.notion.site/StigFlow-ba08c08cef724a84a277e90d11ee634a).

Please note that StigFlow is a proof-of-concept and a work in progress. The current alpha version focuses on a Discord bot that continuously listens to activity on various Discord channels and pushes content into ArangoDB. It can also publish content based on pre-defined flows into webhooks, we use Pipedream to create webhook flows which make it easy to experiment, iterate and prototype different flows. We use it with Notion, for creating multi-community knowledge gardens, and experiment with LLM for generating abstracts.   

We welcome your feedback and contributions to help us improve StigFlow.

See the documentation file for information on how to run your own instance.
